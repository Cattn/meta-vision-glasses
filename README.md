# Meta Vision Glasses (name pending)
Let your glasses see for you!

## Installation
- ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
- Ensure you've setup your openai token as an environment variable (per official docs) OR just add it to main.py
- Run main.py
- Quickly tab over to a Messenger window with your bot account

## Usage
- On the glasses, say "Hey meta, send a picture to [Account Name]"
- Confirm the name
- Then optionally, you can say "Hey meta, read out my message" and it'll read out the response.

## Extra
- If you'd like to have custom names for your AI, then create a group with the AI and one other, remove the other, then rename the group to whatever you'd like. Then you will be able to say "Hey meta, send a picture to [Group Name]".
